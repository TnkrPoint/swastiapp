          <ul className='issue-list'>
              <li><span className='caps'>Self-Acceptance:</span> Start by accepting yourself for who you are. Your worth is not defined by others' opinions or acceptance. Embrace your uniqueness and strengths.</li>
              <li><span className='caps'>Mindset Shift: </span>Reframe your perspective. Instead of focusing on the peers who may reject you, concentrate on the quality of your relationships and the positive interactions you have with friends who accept and appreciate you.</li>
              <li><span className='caps'>Seek Support: </span>Talk to someone you trust about your feelings, such as a close friend, family member, or counselor. Sharing your emotions can provide you with emotional support and a different perspective.</li>
              <li><span className='caps'>Self-Compassion: </span>Treat yourself with kindness and understanding. Avoid self-blame or self-criticism for perceived social rejections. Understand that everyone faces rejection at some point.</li>
              <li><span className='caps'>Quality Over Quantity:</span> Prioritize quality over quantity when it comes to friendships. One or a few genuine, supportive friends can be more valuable than many superficial connections.</li>
              <li><span className='caps'>Engage in Interests and Hobbies:</span> Pursue your interests and hobbies. Engaging in activities you love can help you meet like-minded individuals and build meaningful connections.</li>
              <li><span className='caps'>Volunteer and Join Groups:</span> Consider joining clubs, organizations, or volunteer groups that align with your interests. These settings often provide opportunities to meet people who share your passions.</li>
              <li><span className='caps'>Be Open and Approachable: </span>Be open to making new friends but avoid desperation or trying too hard to fit in. Authenticity and being yourself are key to forming genuine connections.</li>
              <li><span className='caps'>Set Realistic Expectations: </span>Recognize that not everyone you meet will become a close friend, and that's okay. It's natural for some connections to remain casual.</li>
              <li><span className='caps'>Practice Self-Reliance: </span>Develop a sense of self-reliance and self-sufficiency. Learn to enjoy your own company, pursue personal growth, and become comfortable with being alone.</li>
              <li><span className='caps'>Stay Positive: </span>Focus on the positive aspects of being alone. It allows you time for self-discovery, personal development, and pursuing your passions without external distractions.</li>
              <li><span className='caps'>Professional Help:</span> If feelings of rejection or loneliness significantly impact your mental health and well-being, consider speaking to a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and support.</li>
